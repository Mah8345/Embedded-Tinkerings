# Embedded Tinkerings

This repository contains a collection of small projects and experiments focused on common embedded systems tasks such as interfacing with LCD displays, Seven-segment display control and other common embedded projects using STM32.


## Overview

These projects are designed for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE. Each project demonstrates fundamental embedded systems concepts like GPIO control, display interfacing, and communication protocols. The repository serves as a personal collection of experiments and learning resources.


## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Embedded-Tinkerings.git
    ```

2. **Open in STM32CubeIDE**:
    - Launch STM32CubeIDE and open the project folder.
    - Build the project using the STM32CubeIDE interface.

3. **Program the microcontroller**:
    - Connect the STM32F103C8T6 board via ST-Link or another programming interface.
    - Flash the firmware onto the board.

## Usage

Each project in the repository is designed to be built and flashed onto the STM32F103C8T6 development board using STM32CubeIDE.
